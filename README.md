The rules in Monopoly GO! follow a familiar structure, but with a few exciting enhancements. Here’s a basic rundown of how to play:

2. **Purchase Properties**: As you land on spaces, you’ll have the opportunity to purchase properties. Some properties will give you income, while others might allow you to upgrade and build hotels or houses to increase their value.

3. **Challenge Other Players**: Monopoly GO! isn’t just about playing against the AI or the game itself. You can also challenge friends and other players in real-time to see who can build the best empire.

4. **Earn Coins and Other Resources**: By completing missions, collecting rent from your properties, or participating in events, you’ll earn coins and other valuable resources to use for future upgrades and dice rolls.

5. **Special Events and Challenges**: The game regularly introduces new special events and seasonal challenges that offer exclusive rewards, so you’ll always have something new to look forward to.
